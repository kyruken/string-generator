# string-generator

This web app is used to generate a list of random, comma-separated strings that can be used by programmers in their programs
as word banks. The web app uses an API called Random Word API that is used to source words from which our web app chooses words
randomly based on parameters provided by the user. The user can choose to either generate words starting with any random letter
of a number of their choosing, or they can specify how many words of each letter the words shall should start with. The web app
then returns a comma-separated list of these words.
